# ETL Process

<div align='center'>
These folders contain the code/scripts used for initializing the tables and relationships to create our database. We utilized a STAR schema structure, separating our data into Fact and Dimension tables. Using this structure allows us to keep our data organized much better than having it all in one table. Furthermore, having our data spread across multiple tables can help load our data more efficiently, saving time and potentially saving costs.
